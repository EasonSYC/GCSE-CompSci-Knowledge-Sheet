 Knowledge Cheat Sheet for CIE IGCSE Computer Science (9-1) from 2023.

 GCSE Computer Science is a knowledge-intense exam. Unlike what most people think, Computer Science is a subject that requires a lot of writing. Therefore, I made this document based on the CIE IGCSE Computer Science (9-1) Syllabus from 2023 onwards. I hope this could help with you IGCSE studies!

 I am also an IGCSE student so errors are inevitable in this document. Feel free to email \href{eason.syc@icloud.com}{eason.syc@icloud.com} to point out any mistakes or submit an issue on the GitHub page!
